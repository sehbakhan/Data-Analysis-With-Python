## Title: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis and Reporting

### Objective:

Build an end-to-end customer purchase behaviour analysis and reporting system using SQL, Python, and PowerBI. This project will help you understand customer purchase patterns, and key performance indicators, and generate insightful reports for business decision-making.

### Problem Statement:

You are provided with a dataset containing customer purchase information for an online retail company. The dataset includes the following details:

- Transaction ID
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Product ID
- Product Name
- Product Category
- Purchase Quantity
- Purchase Price
- Purchase Date
- Country

Your task is to create a comprehensive customer purchase behavior analysis and reporting system by following the steps outlined below:

### Tasks and Deliverables:

### 1. Data Extraction and Transformation (SQL):

- **Setup a Database**: Create a database to store the customer purchase data.
- **Data Ingestion**: Write SQL scripts to import the provided purchase data into the database.
- **Data Transformation**: Create necessary tables and perform transformations to clean and organize the data. This should include:
    - Normalization of the data.
    - Handling missing values.
    - Creating relationships between tables.
    - Advanced queries to aggregate data (e.g., total purchases per customer, total sales per product, etc.).

### 2. Data Analysis (Python):

- **Data Extraction**: Write a Python script to extract data from the SQL database.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform the following analysis using basic Python:
    - Calculate total purchases, total revenue, and average purchase value.
    - Identify top customers and their purchasing behavior.
    - Analyze purchase trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
    - Identify the top-performing product categories.
    - Generate a summary report with key insights.
